Changelog

2.1.9
- fixed head movement issue in idle mode

2.1.8
- minor internal fixes and improvements

2.1.7
- Characters no longer need to have head and eyes look straight at Play start:
	In Setup, the first button to save "Eyes open, head and eyes straight" now requires the head and eyes to be straight with respect to the character's forward direction. This is because it now stores all necessary head and eye rotation offsets, so once setup is complete and stored, the character does not need to look straight at Play start anymore but can be in any pose.
	Note that this only works for characters that are newly set up or for which you imported one of the new presets. If your character was set up before the update, you can save "Eyes open, head and eyes straight" again (make sure head and eyes are straight) and save the scene to store the offsets and to no longer have to have the character look straight at Play start.
- Added "Automatic Blinking" checkbox.
- fixed issue with timeScale 0
- fixed serialization issues with prefabs

2.1.6
- New optional eye positions that you can save: Looking Left and Looking Right.
	You can set these to determine how much the eyes can look to the sides. Furthermore, if you use blendshapes for eyelid control and have appropriate blendshapes like "Looking_left" etc., you can make the eyelid bulge follow the eyes horizontally, so the eyelid bulge follows the pupil. The preset for Reallusion's CC4 characters already supports this. So does the preset for Reallusion's CC3+ characters that use ExPlus blendshapes. There is also a new preset for DAZ characters with eyelid side-movement support, read the Readme_Blendshapes.txt file in the DAZ preset folder to find out which blendshapes you have to export from DAZ for it to work.
- New parameter in LookTargetController: Avoid looking through player.
	If you check the checkbox Avoid Looking Through Player, the character will try to avoid choosing look targets that happens to be on the other side of the player. You can use this to avoid the character seemingly looking at the player when they are actually looking at the target behind the player.


2.1.5
- Fixed issue with OpenXR not doing the social triangle.

2.1.4
-Optional delegates on LookTargetController for more control
	IsPlayerInViewDelegate
		Used to determine whether the player is in view, and can be looked at. Register your own function here if you want some more custom logic, for example based on distance, raycasting to see whether there are occluding things in between etc.
	IsPlayerLookingAtMeDelegate
		Used to determine whether that player is looking at the character (for example to decide whether to stare back). Register your own function here if you want some more custom logic, for example based on distance, raycasting to see whether there are occluding things in between etc.
	GetPOIsDelegate
		Called every time the character is ready to look at a new thing. Returns the things that the character can choose from to look at. So instead of assigning a fixed list at start, you can update the points of interest whenever needed via this delegate. This is useful if there are changing/appearing/disappearing things in the environment that the character can look at. For example, in VR House Disco, every time the character is ready to look at a new target, this delegate returns the other dancers in front of the character as potential look targets to choose from.
- Updated presets.
-Replaced head and neck tilt angle with three each: pitch, roll and yaw. These angles are now applied after the head oriented towards the target. The head angles are applied not only for HeadControl set to Transform but also AnimatorIK and FinalIK.
- Fixed issue where blinking didn't close the eyelids completely when looking up or down or eyeWidenOrSquint widened the eyes.
- Fixed some issues when FinalIK components are not enabled at start.
- Fixed issue when looking at player and the player camera switches from one to another.


2.1.3
- Switched to new head animation method HillHybrid. The old method SmoothDamp is still available if you want.
- Added new parameters Head Tilt and Neck Tilt in case you want to "roll" the head around the forward axis.
- Replaced parameter Nervousness with parameters Saccade Speed, Microsaccades per Minute and Macrosaccades per Minute.

2.1.2
- Made blinking more realistic with data from the paper "High-speed camera characterization of voluntary eye blinking kinematics"
- Added parameters IdleTargetHorizAngle, HeadJitterFrequency and headJitterAmount
- Implemented workaround for bug in SteamVR when using new Unity XR that reported wrong positions for left and right eye

2.1.1
- Added ability to fade REM in and out smoothly: 
	- mainWeight 
	- eyesWeight 
	- eyelidsWeight 
- Updated UMA preset

2.1.0
When updating, please delete the old RealisticEyeMovement folder first.
- Presets now use json instead of a binary format.
- Added preset for DAZ Studio characters.
- Added support for multiple bones per eyelid.
- New parameter "Update Mode" which has these options:
	- LateUpdate (default, as before)
	- FixedUpdate (if your animator is set to Animate Physics)
	- External (replaces the setting "areUpdatesControlledExternally")
- New parameter "Head Control" which has these options:
	- AnimatorIK (default, uses Mecanim's OnAnimatorIK)
	- Transform (custom head orientation for explicitly set head bone/object)
	- FinalIK (if your character uses LookAtIK, set this option)
	- Head Target (keeps updating the position of an object that you can use as target for Animation Rigging or other systems that orient that head towards a target)
	- None
- Deprecated support for Morph 3D (MCS) characters, because MCS itself has been discontinued.
- Replaced Head Speed Modifier by two parameters: head speed when changing to new target and head speed for tracking target.
